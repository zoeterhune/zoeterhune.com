					strings: ["I joined her at the breakfast table this morning. She was rubbing her implant; I couldn\u2019t tell if it was absentminded or deliberate. I sat across from her and she smiled at me, but it was the kind of smile that doesn\u2019t reach your eyes. Sad. Empty. She extended her wrist toward me so I could see her countdown. \r\n\r\nZero.\r\n\r\nZero days.\r\n\r\nI still wasn\u2019t sure what the implant meant\u2014no one tells you. Rumors are spread at school, but none of them were convincing enough. We all know that the timer counts down days, but none of us knew what happened when the timer ran out.\r\n\r\nHer \u201Cexpiration date,\u201D she called it, like she was a carton of milk. \u201CWhen your clock hits zero, you can\u2019t have babies anymore,\u201D she had said. Every day logged on your implant is a day you\u2019re still fertile.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat happens after?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe didn\u2019t answer me.  She just sat there, continuing to look at the little zero in her wrist.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat happens when the timer runs out?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey used to call it menopause. Your grandmother once told me that the women in our family always went through it relatively early. It only meant that you would stop having periods, stop having babies. But then they started putting the implant in every little girl once she got her first period and when their clock struck zero, when they normally would have just reached menopause, now\u2014\u201D And she paused. She swallowed. \u201CThey die.\u201D\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t remember if I said anything. I don\u2019t think I did. I think she tried to talk over the fact that this meant that she was going to die and she was going to die today. \u201CIt\u2019s not just in your wrist. It\u2019s not just in your ovaries. They also stick some probes right on your brain. It just\u2014it just kills you.\u201D\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t really believe it, at first. But it probably had more to do with the fact that I didn\u2019t want to believe it. Because I realized I had never met either of my grandmothers. My aunt, my mom\u2019s older sister, had mysteriously died two years ago. I\u2019d never even met any old women. Plenty of old men, though. And Mom had a tired look to her. She used to have bags under her eyes because she worked early and went to sleep late. Today those bags were a sort of gaunt depression. They were turning blue. Her cheeks started to hollow out. Her skin had started to gray.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey don\u2019t want us to do much more than give birth. Then they\u2019re in charge of everything else.\u201D She stood up, slowly. She had to balance herself by putting both hands on the table in front of her. \u201CI\u2019m going to go rest. Come sit with me a while.\u201D\r\n\r\nI sat by her bed for probably about three hours after that. Dad was still at work, but Mom said he knew that her timer had run out. \u201CHe wanted to be here,\u201D she insisted. I\u2019m not sure she was trying to convince me. \r\n\r\nI watched her deteriorate in front of me. She became harder and harder to understand as the hours passed. Her sentences just became strings of words, then a series of moans. She held my hand throughout her expiration, but her hold began to soften. Like there was less of her there, less of her in existence. And suddenly, her moaning stopped. It had gotten really soft at that point, like a drawn out whisper. Then she went quiet. It was as though she had gotten hit really hard in the stomach and the wind was knocked out of her. \r\n\r\nI untangled my fingers from hers. I didn\u2019t really cry, though I wanted to. I felt more empty and scared than sad. Every time I thought of her being truly, absolutely dead, I felt a sharp pain in my stomach. Like every part of me\u2014both my mind and my body\u2014was hurting. \r\n\r\nI felt like I had to get my implant out. If it stayed, the same thing that had just happened to my mother would happen to me. I began tearing at the skin around my clock, trying to pry it out. Now I cried. My fingernails dug into my own flesh and it started to bleed and sting and the implant felt like it was throbbing and my nails felt heavy, thick, as skin began to build up under them and I stopped, not because it hurt too bad but because I remembered what my mother had said about the implant being on your ovaries and your brain and so I stopped.\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t realize how heavily I had been breathing.\r\n\r\nI would never be able to get rid of the implant. That was the point, I guess. That foreign screen was part of me until its clock ran out. No, even then, after that, after my expiration, after my death, it would still be a part of me. They would bury it with me. Or they would bury me with it. \r\n\r\nI rubbed the blood off my wrist. That little clock read 11,733.\r\n"],
